# Predicting-House-Prices-Using-Neural-Networks

This project consists of use of TensorFlow and various libraries in Jupyter Notebook, to analyze house price dataset, to make and train a neural network model of certain architecture, so as to make further predictions. This required basic understanding of Machine Learning and various Python Tools.

Files:

1.House_Prediction.ipynb: Consists step by step execution of the project, which consists of loading the data, analysing it, creation and training of model and further analysis.

2.data.csv: Consists of the data set of 5000 record and 6 features.
